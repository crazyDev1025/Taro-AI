                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p><strong>Taro AI Foundation</strong>, a foundation company limited by guarantee incorporated in the
                        Cayman Islands (“Taro AI”, “we”, “our”) welcomes you (the “User(s)”, or “you”) to <a
                            href="https://app.taroai.org">dApp</a> (the “Site”), a website that provides
                        information and hosts a user interface (the “Interface”) to the Taro AI protocol, a decentralized
                        protocol on the Ethereum Blockchain (and its Layer 2s) that provides an execution layer tool
                        that can be used by users to instruct trade orders over DeFi protocols (the “Taro AI Protocol”).
                        Each User may use the Site and/or Interface in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and
                        conditions hereunder. </p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p><strong>Acceptance of the Terms</strong></p>

                        that you have read and understood the following Terms of Service (collectively, the “Terms”),
                        and you agree to be bound by them and to comply with all applicable laws and regulations
                        regarding your use of the Site and the Interface, and you acknowledge that these Terms
                        constitute a binding and enforceable legal contract between Taro AI and you. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO
                        THESE TERMS, PLEASE DO NOT ENTER, CONNECT TO, ACCESS OR USE THE SITE AND/OR INTERFACE IN ANY
                        MANNER. </p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p>The Site and Interface are available only to individuals who (a) are at least eighteen (18) years
                        old; and (b) possess the legal capacity to enter into these Terms (on behalf of themselves and
                        their organization) and to form a binding agreement under any applicable law. You hereby
                        represent that you possess the legal authority to enter into these Terms on your and (if
                        applicable) your organization’s behalf and to form a binding agreement under any applicable law,
                        to use the Site and the Interface in accordance with these Terms, and to fully perform your
                        obligations hereunder.</p>
                    <p>For the avoidance of doubt, if you are acting on behalf of an organization, any act or omission
                        performed by you in connection with the Site and/or Interface shall obligate your organization.
                    </p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p><strong>Please be advised that these Terms contain provisions, including an Agreement to Arbitrate, that govern how claims that you may have or assert against Taro AI are resolved, which will require the parties to submit claims they may have against one another to binding and final arbitration. Under the Agreement to Arbitrate, the parties will (1) only be permitted to pursue claims against each other on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative action or proceeding and (2) only be permitted to seek relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) on an individual basis.</strong>

                    <p><strong>The Site, Interface and Protocol – Explanation and Certain Risk Factors</strong></p>
                    <p>The Site and Interface do not offer the Protocol. The Protocol is a decentralized protocol on the
                        Ethereum Blockchain (and its Layer 2s), and which may be accessed independently without use of
                        the Site or the Interface.</p>
                    <p>These Terms relate solely to the Site and the Interface. Use of the Protocol and any activity
                        thereon may be subject to additional terms located at <a
                            href="https://github.com/grixprotocol">https://github.com/grixprotocol</a>.</p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p><strong>YOUR USE OF THE PROTOCOL IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.</strong></p>
                    <p>On the Site, you will have the ability via the Interface to access the Protocol. More information
                        about the Protocol is available here: <a
                            href="https://docs.taroai.org">https://docs.taroai.org</a>.</p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p><strong>Decentralized Protocol</strong> </p>
                    <p>The Protocol is a decentralized smart contract running on the Ethereum blockchain (and its Layer
                        2s). The Interface provides an Interface to access the Protocol in a user-friendly manner. The
                        Protocol was written and released by a group of developers, not by Taro AI Foundation. Taro AI was
                        formed to promote the adoption of the Protocol, however Taro AI does not control the Protocol. By
                        using the Interface, you acknowledge and recognize that use of the Protocol and deposit of
                        cryptocurrencies or other digital assets in the Protocol is at your own risk and will be subject
                        to the rules encoded within the Protocol, including as to when and on what terms any
                        transactions may be executed, neither of which Taro AI can influence or has any control over.</p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p><strong>Software Programs that the Protocol Interacts With</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>‍</strong>The Protocol interacts with certain software programs that were developed and
                        may be operated by MC14 Labs Ltd., the initiator of the Protocol (“MC14”). Further information
                        regarding such software programs is located at <a
                            href="https://docs.taroai.org">https://docs.taroai.org</a>. MC14 does
                        not receive any consideration for the operation of such software programs. Therefore, such
                        programs are provided on an as-is and where-is basis, without any representations or warranties
                        of any kind.</p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p><strong>Third-Party Protocols</strong></p>
                    <p>The Protocol serves as an aggregator of various third-party DeFi options protocols and AMMs. The
                        Protocol does not execute trades, rather it routes your trades to such third-party protocols.
                        The third party protocols are not developed, controlled or monitored by Taro AI and Taro AI has no
                        affiliation with them. Use of the third party protocols, and any losses that you may incur as a
                        result of such use, is at your own risk and liability.</p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p><strong>Rates</strong> </p>
                    <p>The Protocol attempts to locate the best rates for your trades. However, there is no guarantee
                        that the Protocol will actually locate the best rates or that you will receive the best rates
                        for your trades by routing them through the Protocol.</p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p><strong>Governance</strong></p>
                    <p>Certain aspects of the Protocol will be decided by a DAO or other decentralized governance
                        arrangement. Such governance mechanisms may make changes to the Protocol from time to time, with
                        or without notice, at its sole discretion. You are responsible for monitoring any communications
                        or announcements regarding such changes, updates or upgrades, and ensuring that any continued
                        use of the Protocol meets your needs and requirements.</p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p><strong>Risk Disclosures Relating to Blockchain</strong></p>
                    <p>By utilizing the Interface, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with
                        cryptographic systems; and warrant that you have an understanding of the usage and intricacies
                        of cryptographic tokens, digital assets, blockchains and other distributed and decentralized
                        systems, and smart contracts. In particular, you are aware and recognize that any transactions
                        conducted on a blockchain cannot be undone or reversed.</p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p><strong>Information</strong></p>
                    <p>The Site may contain information regarding the Protocol or particular instances of the Protocol.
                        Such information is provided for informational purposes only, without any representation or
                        warranty. Taro AI does not assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or inaccuracy of
                        any such information. Before acting upon or making any decisions on the basis of such
                        information, you are responsible to independently verify such information.</p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p><strong>Fees</strong></p>
                    <p>There are fees and costs associated with using the Protocol, a description of which can be found
                        at <a href="https://docs.taroai.org">https://docs.taroai.org</a>. Taro AI does
                        not currently charge a fee for the use of the Interface.  However, we reserve the right to do so
                        in the future, and in such case shall display to you any applicable fees prior to you incurring
                        the fee.</p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p><strong>Solvers and Fillers</strong></p>
                    <p>The Protocol relies on third party “Solvers” and “Fillers” that optimize the swapping and
                        purchasing routes for users&#x27; orders. Taro AI and/or affiliated entities may also function as
                        Solvers/Fillers on the network. There is no way of ensuring the availability of Solvers/Fillers
                        on the network, and the Protocol may not function in the absence of sufficient Solvers/Fillers.
                        Taro AI does not control and is not liable for any actions or omissions of the Solvers/Fillers or
                        the results thereof.</p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p><strong>Data Sources</strong></p>
                    <p>Taro AI does not control the source of all data that is accessible via the Interface. The data layer
                        of the Interface, known as “Argus” enables third parties to connect data sources and protocols
                        to Argus, which data will then be included within Interface and the order book. Therefore, Taro AI
                        cannot ensure the reliability of the data that is displayed. You are responsible for verifying
                        the accuracy of all data before taking action.</p>

                    <p><strong>Risks Relating to Options and Derivatives Trading</strong></p>
                    <p>Trading options and derivatives involves substantial risk and is not suitable for all investors.
                        You may lose your entire investment or more than your initial investment due to the complex
                        nature of options and derivatives, market volatility, and leverage effects. Before trading
                        options and derivatives, carefully consider your investment objectives, experience level, and
                        risk tolerance. Past performance is not indicative of future results.</p>

                        any breach or default hereunder will be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent

                        by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, that provision shall be limited or
                        eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full
